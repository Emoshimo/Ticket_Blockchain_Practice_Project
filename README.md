# Ticket Sale Project
The Ticket Sale Project is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates ticket sales for events using blockchain technology. The project utilizes React for the front end, Solidity for the smart contract, and Hardhat for deployment and testing.

# Project Overview
In this project, we've developed a dApp that allows event organizers to create events and sell tickets in a decentralized and secure manner using blockchain. Smart contracts written in Solidity govern the ticket sale process, ensuring transparency and immutability.

Key Components
1. Frontend (React)
The React application serves as the user interface for both event organizers and attendees. It allows users to view available events, purchase tickets. Ethers.js is used to connect smart contracts to client side.

2. Smart Contract (Solidity)
The Solidity smart contract defines the rules for event creation and ticket sale. It manages the allocation and sale of tickets, handles transactions, and maintains an immutable record of event and ticket data on the blockchain.

3. Deployment and Testing (Hardhat)
Hardhat is utilized for deploying the smart contract to a blockchain and testing its functionality. It provides a development environment for Solidity contracts, facilitating local testing and deployment to various Ethereum networks.
